First, to our knowledge, Belarusian Cyrillic to Latin converter that
 - systematically cares to render Belarusian phonology correctly. In concerns, i.e.,
   - the regressive palatalization issue (i.e. /s<sup>j</sup>n<sup>j</sup>ɛɣ/ is rendered “śnieh“ and not “snieh”). Overpalatalized dentals constituting a characteristic feature of Belarusan (so-called “dziekańnie”, “ciekańnie”), it is primordial to render them correctly **systematically**; 
   - the laxist graphic convention of the official Cyrillic system as to the letter «г»: may denote /ɣ<sup>(j)</sup>/ or /g<sup>(j)</sup>/ with no evident pattern: “гісторыя”/“гузік”);
   - the laxist graphic convention of the official Cyrillic system as to the letter «і»: may denote /і/ or /jі/ with no evident pattern trigerring two different palatalization patterns: “ім”/“інтэгральны” → “з ім”/“з інтэгральнага” /і→ы/ /jі→<sup>(j)</sup>i/;
   - the laxist graphic convention of the official Cyrillic system as to the letter «e»: in borrowed words, it may confer or not palatalization to the previous consonant with no evident pattern: “веласіпед”/“Аве Марыя” /v/ and /v<sup>(j)</sup>i/;
- complies with the official Belarus's [prescription](https://be.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%86%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%86%D1%8B%D1%8F_%D0%BF%D0%B0_%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BB%D1%96%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D1%8B%D1%96) to use the alphabet «abcćčdefhijklĺmnńoprsśštuŭvyzžź» and the [UN standard](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/docs/9th-uncsgn-docs/crp/9th_UNCSGN_e-conf-98-crp-21.pdf)  based thereupon;
 - complies with the official Belarus's Orthographic rules (law  №420-3 ”On the Rules of Belarusan orthography and punctuation” as of 23/07/2008 h.”
 
We are aware of the following toy converters: [],[]. All of them fail already at the stage of phonetics.
